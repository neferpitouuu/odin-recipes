    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>ts name comes from the Spanish word for pastry, pastilla (pronounced pas-tee-yah)! Pastilla is a rustic, sweet-and-savory North African chicken pie </p> <p> made of a tender shredded chicken filling and shaved almonds,</p>
    <p>seasoned with warm spices (including Ras El Hanout), and nestled in layers of flaky phyllo pastry. It tastes just as good as it sounds, and it's easier to make than most people think!</p>
